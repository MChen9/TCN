# TCN
Implementation of Temporal Convolutional Network Based on Tensorflow

Can be used for any higher dimensional datasets, rather than only the one dimension seqence described in the original implementation

The paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271

TO use: can be used as a block of model in any tf model

TODO: update the code config into a tf.keras interface. 


Created  minimum examples of how to use the model
