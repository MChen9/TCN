# TCN
Implementation of Temporal Convolutional Network Based on Tensorflow

The paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271

TO use: can be used as a block of model in any tf model

TODO: update the code config into a tf.keras interface. 

Created  minimum examples of how to use the model
